# Hello Contributors!

## You rock! 

### First off, thank you for considering contributing to PLACEHOLDER. It's people like you that make PLACEHOLDER such a great tool.

### These guidelines should hopefully establish a basic idea of what PLACEHOLDER is looking for regarding contributions. PLACEHOLDER is designed to be open-source, and community input is welcome!

### Improving documentation, bug triaging, or writing tutorials are all examples of helpful contributions to PLACEHOLDER.


# Ground Rules

### These include not just how to communicate with others (being respectful, considerate, etc) but also technical responsibilities (importance of testing, project dependencies, etc). 

## Responsibilities

> * Ensure cross-platform compatibility for every change that's accepted. Windows, Mac, Debian & Ubuntu Linux.
> * Create issues for any major changes and enhancements that you wish to make. Discuss things transparently and get community feedback.
> * Keep feature versions as small as possible, preferably one new feature per version.
> * Be welcoming to newcomers and encourage diverse new contributors from all backgrounds. See the [Python Community Code of Conduct](https://www.python.org/psf/codeofconduct/).

## Your First Contribution

### New to PLACEHOLDER? Read on. 

> Unsure where to begin contributing to PLACEHOLDER? You can start by looking through these beginner and help-wanted issues:
> * Beginner issues - issues which should only require a few lines of code, and a test or two.
> * Help wanted issues - issues which should be a bit more involved than beginner issues.
> * Both issue lists are sorted by total number of comments. While not perfect, number of comments is a reasonable proxy for impact a given change will have.

### New to Github or Coding in General? 
> * If a maintainer asks you to "rebase" your PR, they're saying that a lot of code has changed, and that you need to update your branch so it's easier to merge.
> * Working on your first Pull Request? You can learn how from this *free* series, [How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub](https://egghead.io/series/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github).
> * Here are a couple of friendly tutorials: http://makeapullrequest.com/ and http://www.firsttimersonly.com/
> * At this point, you're ready to make your changes! Feel free to ask for help; everyone is a beginner at first.

# Getting started

>For something that is bigger than a one or two line fix:
>1. Create your own fork of the code
>2. Do the changes in your fork
>3. If you like the change and think the project could use it:
    * Be sure you have followed the code style for the project.
  
>As a rule of thumb, changes are obvious fixes if they do not introduce any new functionality or creative thinking. As long as the change does not affect functionality, some likely examples include the following:
>* Spelling / grammar fixes
>* Typo correction, white space and formatting changes
>* Comment clean up
>* Bug fixes that change default return values or error codes stored in constants
>* Adding logging messages or debugging output
>* Changes to ‘metadata’ files like .gitignore, build scripts, etc.
>* Moving source files from one directory or package to another

# How to report a bug
> If you find a security vulnerability, do NOT open an issue. Email mbartho@stanford.edu instead.

> Any security issues should be submitted directly to mbartho@stanford.edu. In order to determine whether you are dealing with a security issue, ask yourself these two questions:
> * Can I access something that's not mine, or something I shouldn't have access to?
> * Can I disable something for other people?
>
> If the answer to either of those two questions are "yes", then you're probably dealing with a security issue. Note that even if you answer "no" to both questions, you may still be dealing with a security issue, so if you're unsure, just email us at security@travis-ci.org.

### How to file a bug report
You can even include a template so people can just copy-paste (again, less work for you).

> When filing an issue, make sure to answer these five questions:
>
> 1. What version of PLACEHOLDER are you using?
> 2. What operating system and processor architecture are you using?
> 3. What did you do?
> 4. What did you expect to see?
> 5. What did you see instead?


# How to suggest a feature or enhancement
### Explain your desired process for suggesting a feature.
If there is back-and-forth or signoff required, say so. Ask them to scope the feature, thinking through why it’s needed and how it might work.

> If you find yourself wishing for a feature that doesn't exist in Elasticsearch, you are probably not alone. There are bound to be others out there with similar needs. Many of the features that Elasticsearch has today have been added because our users saw the need. Open an issue on our issues list on GitHub which describes the feature you would like to see, why you need it, and how it should work.

# Code review process

> The core team looks at Pull Requests on a regular basis.
> After feedback has been given we expect responses within two weeks. After two weeks we may close the pull request if it isn't showing any activity.
